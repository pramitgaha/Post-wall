# post_wall

Post Wall is a twitter look-a-like application built on ICP blockchain. It uses [ic-stable-memory](https://github.com/seniorjoinu/ic-stable-memory) to enjoy a larger store of 48GB stable memory (at the time or writing).

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.
